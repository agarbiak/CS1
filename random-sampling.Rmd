# Random Sampling

## Learning Objectives {-#objectives-random-sampling}

1. Explain what is meant by a sample, a population and statistical inference.
2. Define a random sample from a distribution of a random variable.
3. Explain what is meant by a statistic and its sampling distribution.
4. Determine the mean and variance of a sample mean and the mean of a sample variance in terms of the population mean, variance and sample size.
5. State and use the basic sampling distributions for the sample mean and the sample variance for random samples from a normal distribution.
6. State and use the distribution of the $t$-statistic for random samples from a normal distribution.
7. State and use the $F$ distribution for the ratio of two sample variances from independent samples taken from normal distributions.
